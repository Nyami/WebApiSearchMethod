# WebApiSearchMethod

Inspired by WebDAV's SEARCH method this demonstrates how to create a custom attribute to enable support for the HTTP Verb SEARCH on an Action, essentaly this is a 'GET with body'. Useful for those situations where limitations on GET might result in POST actions for returning data from your RESTful API.
